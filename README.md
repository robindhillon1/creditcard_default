# About 

Institutions such as banks are concerned of individuals who might default on payments (such as loans, credit cards, and more) as this leads to monetary loss and would also negatively impact the health and reputation of the institution. Thus, catching genuine defaults as well as *predicting* individuals who might default is something such institutions are very interested in. This project focuses on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. We use the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset), which contains 30,000 examples and 24 features. The goal of this project is to predict whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills.
